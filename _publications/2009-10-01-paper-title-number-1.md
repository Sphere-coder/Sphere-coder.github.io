Abstract:
Silicone elastomers have been widely used for biomedical applications. A variety of hyperelastic models have
been proposed to describe this type of materials in the past few decades. The assessment of the quality of
the proposed models is mostly based on stressâ€“strain data obtained from uniform deformation, but very little
work has been done to investigate model performances with heterogeneous deformation fields and full-field
characterization methods. In this study, thirteen hyperelastic models are evaluated using the virtual fields
method combined with full-field deformation data obtained from biaxial tests. The quality of these models is
assessed by their capabilities to predict the mechanical responses of silicone elastomers, and the influences of
the first and second invariants on modeling of elastomers are investigated through comparative studies between
models. The results indicate that for elastomers under finite biaxial deformation, Yeoh model performs the
best among selected models; the first invariant plays an important role in constitutive modeling; the second
invariant does not have obvious influence on improving the fitting performance. This study provides a full-field
method to calibrate and compare hyperelastic models of silicone elastomers under biaxial loading conditions
