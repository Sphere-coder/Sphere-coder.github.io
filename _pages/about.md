Hi, I am Jiawen Dai, an ordinary guy. On this website, I aim to share my research interest, achievement, some personal insights even my life with you all.

## Brief Bibliography

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018. Following that, I embarked on a one-year journey to Beijing for studying the German. During my language studies, I had the opportunity to meet many fellow students specializing in robotics. They took me on visits to their laboratories and even accompanied me to witness the **[2019 World Robot Conference](https://www.worldrobotconference.com/)**. These experiences significantly expanded my understanding of robotics and ignited my passion for the field.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, international travel became increasingly restricted. In the early stages of the pandemic, I explored various European regions, including Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as the entire Southeast Asian region, especially Vietnam. However, travel opportunities diminished in the later stages of the pandemic, prompting me to extensively explore various regions across China, immersing myself in the diverse cultures and landscapes.

Upon my return to my hometown in 2021, I embarked on a journey of entrepreneurship with some friends, though success remained elusive. Even amidst my professional endeavors, I maintained my passion for robotics, I enrolled in the Robotics series of courses delivered by University of Pennsylvania on Coursera and completed the assessments, gaining valuable insights into the algorithms and principles commonly used in the field of robotics.

In 2022, I joined **[Prof. Zhujiang Wang](https://research.gtiit.edu.cn/en/persons/zhujiang-wang)**'s research group at the Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology (GTIIT) as a research assistant. There, I engaged in research related to computer graphics, biomechanics, and robot control. Currently, I am a research assistant under the supervision of **[Prof. Zhenyu Xu](http://laiw.scu.edu.cn/web/team/ff80808174f8a8a30175cb179d8a0011)**' at the School of Computer Science, Sichuan University, focusing on high-precision 3D scene reconstruction.
